App Master Terms & Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 01, 2026
By creating an account or using app as either a Customer or a Merchant, you agree to the following terms.

SECTION 1: GENERAL TERMS (Applies to Everyone)
1.1 The Platform
This is a digital marketplace connecting users with local promotions. We provide the technology to facilitate these connections but are not a party to any transaction between a Customer and a Merchant.
1.2 Privacy & Data (Privacy Policy)
•	Location Data: We collect real-time GPS data to show Customers relevant nearby deals and to provide Merchants with analytics. If you grant permission, we may track your location in the background to send "Flash Sale" notifications.
•	Control: You can disable location services in your device settings at any time, but doing so will significantly limit the app’s functionality.
•	Personal Info: We collect names, emails, and device IDs to manage accounts and prevent fraud.
•	Third Parties: We do not sell your personal data. We may share anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., "100 people viewed this deal") with our partners.
•	Data Deletion: You may request the deletion of your account and all associated personal data at any time through the app settings or by contacting our support email.
1.3 Eligibility & Security
•	Age: You must be at least 18 years old to use app.
•	Account Responsibility: You are responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately if you suspect a security breach.
